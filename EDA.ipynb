    "## Introduction\n",
    "- Population data is a critical aspect of understanding the dynamics of a region or a country. One of the essential metrics that demographers and policymakers use to assess population movement is the Crude Net Migration Rate (CNMR). CNMR represents the net migration per 1,000 population, indicating the inflow and outflow of people in a particular area. This metric plays a pivotal role in making informed decisions about resource allocation, urban planning, and economic policies."

    "### Definition of Crude Net Migration Rate\n",
    "`The Crude Net Migration Rate (CNMR)` is a demographic and population statistic that measures the net migration in a specific area, usually expressed per 1,000 population. It provides insights into the movement of people into and out of a particular region, country, or area within a specific time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of what each component of the term means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Crude**: In this context, `crude` means that it is a simple and unadjusted measure. It doesn't take into account various demographic factors or age groups. It provides a basic, overall view of net migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Net Migration**: Net migration refers to the difference between the number of people immigrating (moving into the area) and the number of people emigrating (moving out of the area). If more people are moving into the area than leaving it, the net migration is positive, indicating population growth due to migration. Conversely, if more people are leaving the area than arriving, the net migration is negative, indicating population decline due to migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rate**: The term `rate` indicates that this measurement is standardized by expressing it as a rate per 1,000 population. This normalization allows for comparisons between regions or countries with different population sizes. It makes the CNMR a relative measure that facilitates the assessment of migration patterns regardless of the population's size.\n",
    "\n",
    "`CNMR` is a valuable statistic for understanding population dynamics and migration trends in different geographic areas. It is often used by demographers, policymakers, and researchers to analyze and plan for changes in population due to migration, which can have significant social, economic, and political implications."

    "1. **High Correlation Between Deaths and Births:** There is a very strong positive correlation (close to 1) between the number of deaths and the number of births. This suggests that as the number of births increases, the number of deaths also increases, which could be indicative of larger population sizes where both births and deaths are naturally higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High Correlation Between Births and Under-5 Deaths:** There is also a very strong positive correlation between the number of births and the number of deaths under 5 years old. This could imply that higher birth rates are associated with higher mortality rates in young children, possibly due to factors affecting infant and child health.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Moderate Positive Correlation Between Doubling Time and Median Age of Population:** There is a moderate positive correlation (approximately 0.62) between the median age of the population and the doubling time of the population. This may indicate that populations with a higher median age tend to grow more slowly, which aligns with demographic trends where populations with older age profiles have lower growth rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Low or No Correlation Between Median Age of Population and Births/Deaths:** The correlation between the median age of the population and the number of births and deaths is very low or almost non-existent. This suggests that the median age may not directly affect the number of births or deaths within the same period.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Negative Correlation Between Doubling Time and Under-5 Deaths:** There is a small negative correlation (approximately -0.10) between doubling time and under-5 deaths, which could suggest that as the rate of population growth slows down (higher doubling time), the number of under-5 deaths slightly decreases. However, this correlation is relatively weak and may not indicate a strong relationship.\n"
